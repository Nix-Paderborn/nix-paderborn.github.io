## Legal Basis

In accordance with Article 13 GDPR, we inform you of the legal basis of our data processing. Generally, your consent is the basis for storing data. However, under certain technically mandatory conditions, data can be stored without your explicit consent. In these cases, the following applies: The legal basis for obtaining consent is Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR, the legal basis for processing for the performance of our services and execution of contractual measures as well as responding to inquiries is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the legal basis for processing to fulfill our legal obligations is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR, and the legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. In cases where vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.

## Security Measures

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, in accordance with Article 32 GDPR, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

Measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data as well as access, input, transmission, ensuring availability, and separation of the data. We also have procedures in place that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data endangerment. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data already in the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures, according to the principle of data protection through technology design and through privacy-friendly default settings (Article 25 GDPR).

## Cooperation with Processors and Third Parties

If we disclose data to other persons and companies (processors or third parties) within the scope of our processing, transmit it to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of a legal permission (e.g., if a transmission of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, is necessary for the performance of a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), you have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., when using agents, web hosts, etc.).

If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called "processing contract", this is done on the basis of Article 28 GDPR.

## Transfers to Third Countries

If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this is done in the context of the use of third-party services or disclosure, or transmission of data to third parties, this will only be done if it is necessary to fulfill our (pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process or allow the data to be processed in a third country only in the presence of the special conditions of Articles 44 et seq. GDPR. This means that the processing takes place, for example, on the basis of specific guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a level of data protection equivalent to that of the EU (e.g., for the USA through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially recognized special contractual obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").

### Right to Object

## Deletion of Data

The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in its processing in accordance with Articles 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless explicitly stated in this Privacy Policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose, and there are no legal retention obligations to prevent deletion. If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted. This means the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons.

## Contacting Us

When contacting us (e.g., via contact form, email, phone, or social media), the user's details are processed to handle the contact request and its processing in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The user's details may be stored in a Customer Relationship Management System (CRM System) or a similar request organization.

We delete the requests if they are no longer necessary. We review the necessity every two years; the statutory archiving obligations also apply.

## Hosting

Our hosting provider collects the following data in so-called log files, which your browser transmits:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, transferred data volume, website from which the request comes, and information about browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest in the sense of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

There is no tracking, and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized, statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page visited, and the number of unique visitors. We do not merge this data with other data.

We use the following hosting provider for providing our website:

GitHub Inc.\
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St\
San Francisco, CA 94107\
United States

They are the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest in the sense of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, not having to maintain a server in our premises. The server location is the USA.

Further information on objections and removal options against GitHub can be found at: <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages>

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful is to be determined as part of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing ceases to apply.

The processing of the data mentioned in this section is neither legally nor contractually required. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all worldwide activities in which GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). More information can be found at:

## Integration of Third-Party Services and Content

We use content or service offers from third-party providers within our online offering on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offering in the sense of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) to integrate their content and services, such as videos (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").

This always requires that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, as they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore necessary for the presentation of this content. We strive to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information, such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time, and further details about the use of our online offering, as well as be combined with such information from other sources.

## Cookie Policy

"Cookies" are small files that are stored on users' computers. Different information can be stored within the cookies. A cookie primarily serves to store information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after their visit to an online offering. "Third-party cookies" are cookies that are offered by providers other than the controller operating the online offering (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, they are referred to as "first-party cookies").

A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for many of the services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US site <https://www.aboutads.info/choices/> or the EU site <https://www.youronlinechoices.com/>. Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be achieved by disabling them in the settings of the browser. Please note that not all functions of this online offering may be used in that case.
